Let's dive into understanding Elastic Beanstalk, a managed platform for deploying various types of applications. It handles infrastructure provisioning, load balancing, auto-scaling, and more, making deployment and management easier.

Preparing IAM Roles:
Due to recent changes, we need to create IAM roles manually for Elastic Beanstalk.
Navigate to IAM, click on Roles, and create a new role with policies like AWS Elastic Beanstalk Web Tier, Administrator Access, AWS Elastic Beanstalk Service Role, and AWS Elastic Beanstalk Enhanced Health Role (optional for email notifications).
Creating the Beanstalk Application:
Go to Elastic Beanstalk and click on "Create Application".
Provide a name (e.g., "vprofile-app") and select a unique domain name.
Choose the platform as Tomcat 8.5 with Corretto 11 and opt for a sample application for now.
Configure environment settings, including instance type, key pair, VPC, security groups, public IP address for instances, and subnet zones.
Skip RDS configuration if it's set up separately and define tags for better organization.
Choose auto-scaling capacity and rolling deployment policy with a batch size appropriate for your setup.
Review the configuration and launch the environment.
Deployment Policies:
Understand deployment policies like Rolling Deployment, Immutable Deployment, and Canary Testing.
Rolling Deployment upgrades instances one at a time to minimize downtime.
Immutable Deployment launches a new set of instances and switches traffic once the new environment is healthy.
Canary Testing splits traffic between old and new instances for a limited time to test the new version with a subset of users.
Post-Deployment:
Monitor environment health, check deployment events for issues, and explore the Elastic Beanstalk dashboard for features like configuration, health, logs, monitoring, and alarms.
