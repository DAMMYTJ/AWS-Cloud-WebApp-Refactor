Let's summarize the steps we've taken to deploy our application successfully and troubleshoot any potential issues:

Configuring Backend Services in the Source Code:
Navigate to the application.properties file in the source code.
Update the MySQL, Memcached, and RabbitMQ details with the correct endpoints, usernames, and passwords.
Ensure the syntax is accurate and save the changes.
Building the Source Code to an Artifact:
Open the terminal and navigate to the project directory.
Run mvn install to build the artifact.
Wait for the build to complete successfully.
Uploading and Deploying the Artifact to Elastic Beanstalk:
Access the Elastic Beanstalk environment in the AWS Management Console.
Choose the main branch and upload the artifact (WAR file) generated in the previous step.
Initiate the deployment and monitor the progress through the event log.
Ensure the deployment completes successfully without errors.
Updating DNS Records for Custom Domain:
Update the DNS records of your domain registrar (e.g., GoDaddy) to point to the Elastic Beanstalk endpoint.
Configure the CNAME record with the desired subdomain (e.g., vprofile.example.com).
Verifying HTTPS Connection:
Check the URL using HTTPS to ensure secure communication.
Confirm that the SSL certificate is valid and the connection is secure.
Testing Database Connectivity:
Attempt to log in to the application using valid credentials.
Verify that the application can connect to the MySQL database without errors.
Troubleshoot any database connectivity issues by checking the application.properties file and security group settings.
Testing RabbitMQ and Memcached Connectivity:
Verify connectivity to RabbitMQ by initiating a connection from the application.
Test Memcached functionality by storing and retrieving data from the cache.
Troubleshoot any issues related to RabbitMQ or Memcached connectivity by checking security group settings and endpoint configurations.
Concluding the Lecture:
Summarize the steps taken during the lecture, emphasizing the importance of accurate configuration and thorough testing.
Encourage students to review each step carefully and troubleshoot any issues encountered during deployment.
Invite students to ask questions or seek clarification on any aspect of the deployment process.
