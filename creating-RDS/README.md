 Subnet Group and Parameter Group Setup:
 
First things first, we need to set up a subnet group and a parameter group for our RDS instance.
Head over to the RDS dashboard in the AWS console.
Click on "Subnet Groups" and create a new one. I'll name it "VProfile-RDS-Subgroup" and select all available subnets.
Next, move to "Parameter Groups" and create a new group for MySQL 8, naming it "VProfile-RDS-ParaGroup".
Creating the RDS Instance:
Now, let's create our RDS instance. Back on the RDS dashboard, click on "Create Database".
Choose MySQL as the engine and version 8.x.
To keep costs low, select a template like "Dev Test" or "Free Tier".
Name your RDS instance and keep the username as "admin" with an autogenerated password.
Choose a DB instance class like DB T3.micro for cost efficiency.
Opt for General Purpose (GP2) storage type with 20GB storage, and consider enabling storage auto-scaling.
For security, select "No" for public accessibility unless absolutely necessary.
Assign the RDS instance to the subnet group and security group we created earlier.
Review the settings and click on "Create Database".
Accessing Credentials:
After the RDS instance is created, make sure to note down the autogenerated password provided in the credentials section.
Keep these credentials safe as we'll need them later for database access.
Next Steps:
Once you've saved the credentials, close the popup.
In the next lecture, we'll dive into configuring additional services like ElastiCache to further enhance our project's infrastructure.
