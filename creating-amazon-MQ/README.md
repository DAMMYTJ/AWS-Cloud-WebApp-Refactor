Now, let's set up RabbitMQ, which will serve as our message broker. This is crucial for managing communication between different components of our project.

Setting up RabbitMQ:
Head over to Amazon MQ and click on "Get Started".
Choose RabbitMQ as our message broker service.
Opt for a single-instance broker to keep costs minimal.
Give the broker a name, such as "vprofile-rmq".
Select instance type as t3.micro to stay within the free tier limits.
Set a username (e.g., "rabbit") and password (e.g., "BlueBunny").
Review additional settings, ensuring private access and selecting the appropriate VPC and security group.
Double-check all settings, especially the password, as it won't be visible later.
Click on "Create Broker" and wait for it to be provisioned.
Checking RDS Status:
While the RabbitMQ broker is being set up, let's check the status of our RDS database.
Navigate back to the RDS dashboard and ensure that the status shows as "available".
Copy the endpoint of the RDS instance for future reference.
Next Steps:
Once the RabbitMQ broker is available and the RDS status is confirmed, we'll proceed to initialize our RDS database instance in the next lecture.
Since our RDS instance doesn't have public accessibility enabled, we'll launch an EC2 instance in the same VPC to initialize the database.
