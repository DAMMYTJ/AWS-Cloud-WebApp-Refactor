I'm currently logged into my AWS console in the North Virginia region. Let's start by creating a Key Pair for our Beanstalk EC2 instance. While it's not mandatory to log into the Beanstalk EC2 instance, having a key pair can be useful for troubleshooting purposes.

Key Pair Creation:
Navigate to the EC2 dashboard and click on "Key Pairs".
Click on "Create Key Pair" and name it as "vprofile-bean-key".
Choose the format as PEM and proceed with the creation.
The private key will be downloaded to my machine, and the public key will be displayed.
Next, we'll set up a security group for our backend services.

Security Group Creation:
Go to the Security Groups section in the EC2 dashboard and click on "Create Security Group".
Name the security group as "vprofile-backend-sg" and provide a description like "Security group for backend services".
Add a dummy rule, for example, allowing port 22 from my IP. While this rule may not be practically used, it's added for initial setup.
Now, add a rule to allow all traffic within the security group by specifying "All traffic" and the security group ID itself.
We'll come back to add additional rules later, especially to allow access from the Beanstalk EC2 instance once it's created.
